This project was something I've had on my mind for quite some time. I couldn't find an app like it so I thought why not build it myself? I've found that to maximise productivity you need momentum. When one task is checked off you feel like its easier to  move on to the next and so on. The main feature of this site will be a github style contribution graph but for how many of your tasks you get done. This way you can see how consistent you are and get motivated to keep that streak up.

Some things This site will include:
- [ ] Task graph
  - The amount of squares in the graph should be the same as the days in the year
  - Each square should represent a day
  - The more tasks you complete in a day the more vibrant the squares color becomes (for that day)
- [ ] Tasks
  - Tasks can be manually added
  - Tasks can be checking if you completed a task on a different platform (e.g duolingo, github)
- [ ] Once this main bit is done I will focus on the fun stuff :)
  - Fun stuff
